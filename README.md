# ocs experiments

Use [run.sh](run.sh) to do the following with Ansible roles

- install code ready containers with [roles/crc](roles/crc)
- install ocs [roles/ocs](roles/ocs) (tbd)
- create pools and cephx key on ocs (tbd)
- create app in namespace which uses rbd from previous step (tbd)

The goal is to get [openstack-k8s-operators](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/dev-tools) using RBD from OCS.
